<h1>Vegetable soup</h1><img src="download.jpg">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<pre>2 tablespoons chopped Spring Onion (or normal onion)
    2 teaspoons minced Garlic
    1/3 cup chopped Carrots
    1/3 cup chopped Green Cabbage
    1/3 cup Sweet Corn Kernels
    1/3 cup chopped French Beans
    1/4 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
    1/2 tablespoon tablespoon Vinegar
    2 tablespoons Cornstarch (white corn flour)
    1/2 tablespoon Butter or Oil
    2½ cups Water or Vegetable Stock
    Salt to taste</pre>
    <h2>INSTRUCTION</h2>
<pre>Chop all the veggies (carrot, cabbage, french beans, onion and garlic) into small pieces as shown in the picture.
    step-2
    Add 2 tablespoons cornstarch (corn flour) in a small bowl.
    step-3
    Add 3 tablespoons water and mix well.
    step-4
    Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil or butter in a large, heavy bottomed stockpot over medium flame. Add chopped onion and garlic.
    step-5
    Sauté for 1-2 minutes.
    step-6
    Add carrots, cabbage, sweet corn kernels, french beans and salt (only for veggies).
    step-7
    Stir and cook for 3-4 minutes.
    step-8
    Add 2½ cups water or vegetable stock. Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil. When it starts boiling, add salt (add as required as we have already added salt for veggies).
    step-9
    Add black pepper powder.
    step-10
    Add cornstarch-water mixture and stir continuously for a minute to prevent lump formation.
    step-11
    Stir and cook until mixture turns thick and no raw smell of cornstarch. It will take around 7-8 minutes. Add vinegar and mix well.
    step-12
    Taste the soup for the seasonings at this stage and add more if required. Turn off the flame. Transfer hot soup of vegetables into individual serving bowls and serve.
