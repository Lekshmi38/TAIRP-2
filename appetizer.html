    See All Nutritional Infor</pre>
    <h2>INSTRUCTION</h2>
<pre>Step 1
    Bring a kettle or large pot of water to a boil. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer on medium-high speed (or in the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat cream cheese and granulated sugar until no lumps remain. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition, then beat in sour cream, flour, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt until just combined. Pour mixture into crust and spread in an even layer.
    Step 2
    Tightly wrap bottom of pan in foil and place in a large roasting pan. Pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up sides of springform pan.
    Step 3
    Bake cheesecake until center only slightly jiggles, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn off oven, prop open door, and let cool in oven, about 1 hour. 
    APPLE PIE FILLING
    Step 1
    Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, toss apples, granulated sugar, cornstarch, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, and 1 cup water until combined. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until apples are knife-tender and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
    Step 2
    Remove cheesecake from oven and remove cheesecake from water bath. Remove foil and place cheesecake in pan on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Spread apple pie filling over top of cheesecake.
    ASSEMBLY
    Step 1
    Increase oven temperature to 425˚. On a lightly floured surface, roll out crust to a rough 10" square. Cut into 10 strips about 1" wide. Arrange half of strips across cheesecake at even intervals. Weave remaining strips under and over perpendicular to other strips to make a lattice. Press edges together to seal.
    Step 2
    In a small bowl, beat egg with 1/4 teaspoon water. Brush top of crust with egg wash. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.
    Step 3
    Bake cheesecake until crust is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 5 hours or up to overnight.</pre>
